/* 

    In HTML, a class is used to style multiple elements with the same design, while an ID is meant for targeting one unique element on a page. You can reuse a class as many times as needed, but an ID should only appear once. In CSS, classes are selected using a dot (.class), and IDs are selected using a hash (#id). So, use classes for general styling and IDs for specific, one-time styling or JavaScript targeting.
